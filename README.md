# Introduction

This is just some base grunt.js settings so that I can set up new project quickly with the grunt.js build tool

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install grunt`

Then modify `grunt.js` by registering npm tasks

View [grunt.js](https://github.com/design48/gruntjs-scaffold/blob/master/grunt.js) for some ideas 

## Documentation
_(Coming soon)_

## Examples / Usage
run `$grunt server reload watch`

open browser to set port

_note_: was having issues with just configuring reload and server task. Got reload to run with LiveReload chrome extension. :thumbsdown:

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt).
